    <ScreenshotText>Ryan Amsalem whispers: So, we got approached yesterday.
&gt; Mikhail Argov nods as he listens to Ryan.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: No idea how they know us to be honest. They need the green vests gone.
Mikhail Argov whispers: The sharmutot who caused a racket last time here?
Ryan Amsalem whispers: Yea, apparently they are not using vests at the moment, I went to the office before opening and downloaded the CCTV into a USB Flashdrive.
&gt; Mikhail Argov nods.
Mikhail Argov whispers: So, I take it someone wants to pay us to get rid of them, wonder why they asking us and hope they pay well, since that's wet-work.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: Well, there's money involved. But apparently whos asking will be a good future business partner if they live to this.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: I'm guessing they're a plug.
Mikhail Argov whispers: Probably, now, two things, they have to pay half at the least, otherwise, it's riskier for us.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: We will keep this on the low.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: I don't want to get alot of people involved, greens find out and we're dead
Mikhail Argov whispers: Need to Know basis is best right now.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: We make them search but don't tell them why and for what reason.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: I'm asking for names atleast.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: With them I can ask our Jew Judge to run their on the database for an address.
