Lior Amsalem says: So that's great. Just what I'm looking for. 
* Joseph Kazarian smirks at Lior.
Lior Amsalem says: I'm not using, brother.

    <ScreenshotText>Ryan Amsalem says: Ok, so, I discussed this with Leo.
Ryan Amsalem says: We currently have a small but steady stream of guns flowing.
* Ryan Amsalem eyes Mikhail as if to grab his full attention.
* Mikhail Argov looks at Ryan as he's speaking.
Ryan Amsalem says: So, we will meet your guy, Eran, we will take these guns to them, and sel them for a cheap price.
Ryan Amsalem says [low]: We make a small profit, maybe none.
Ryan Amsalem says: But, they will provide us backup and men for whatever job we need done.
Ryan Amsalem says: THey refuse to do it, we cut their supply.
Eran Shirazi says: Clear.
Ryan Amsalem says: Basically we are swapping our stream of guns for their labour.
Ryan Amsalem says: We all know that they don't have guns rolling in Davis.
Ryan Amsalem says: We can sort it for a good price. In exchange we need backup we call them, they don't show? - We cut their supply and sell it to someone else.

    <ScreenshotText>Ryan Amsalem whispers: So, we got approached yesterday.
&gt; Mikhail Argov nods as he listens to Ryan.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: No idea how they know us to be honest. They need the green vests gone.
Mikhail Argov whispers: The sharmutot who caused a racket last time here?
Ryan Amsalem whispers: Yea, apparently they are not using vests at the moment, I went to the office before opening and downloaded the CCTV into a USB Flashdrive.
&gt; Mikhail Argov nods.
Mikhail Argov whispers: So, I take it someone wants to pay us to get rid of them, wonder why they asking us and hope they pay well, since that's wet-work.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: Well, there's money involved. But apparently whos asking will be a good future business partner if they live to this.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: I'm guessing they're a plug.
Mikhail Argov whispers: Probably, now, two things, they have to pay half at the least, otherwise, it's riskier for us.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: We will keep this on the low.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: I don't want to get alot of people involved, greens find out and we're dead
Mikhail Argov whispers: Need to Know basis is best right now.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: We make them search but don't tell them why and for what reason.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: I'm asking for names atleast.
Ryan Amsalem whispers: With them I can ask our Jew Judge to run their on the database for an address.
