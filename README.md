# GTA World Screenshot Editor
This program was created with the intention to simplify as much as possible the creation of faction screenshots for the members of the community.

### [Screenshot Editor Forum Thread](https://forum.gta.world/en/topic/60317-guide-screenshot-editor-for-gtaworld/)

## List of features:
- Drag & Drop of the image you want to use.
- Resolution resize of image
- Control over screenshot text (font, text size, shadow, stroke, text thickness)
- Cache of created images, for the times when you mess up but want to correct an already edited image.
- RageMP Chat Parsing, app will pull the chat-log for GTAWorld's chat-log.
- Manual chat-log input & editing
- Chat-log filtration based on selected filter.
- Custom color per line of text.
- Zoom in/out on screenshot canvas without affecting selected resolution or saved screenshot.
- Save screenshot locally or copy screenshot to clipboard so you can post it on discord or other medias.
- "Copy Color" button copies select color from Color Picker in the format (`#00000000`) & copies it into clipboard, allowing you to insert it on start of any line you want to affect it with custom color.
- Custom Image cropping ([Video Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQ2UEOCfnnA)).
